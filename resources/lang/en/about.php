    'introduction-p1'  =>  'Kuno National Park of Madhya Pradesh is one the most unique destination for all wildlife lovers and enthusiasts. As soon as one ventures inside this park they experience the exclusive forest of Kardhai, Khair and Salai and one can see wildlife by the dozens foraging across vast meadows. Some grasslands here are bigger than most at Kanha or Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve.',
    'introduction-p2'  =>  'It is widely believed that Kardhai tree, which is found in abundance here, turns green even with just presence of humidity in atmosphere, even before the arrival of first monsoon showers. In many ways it represents the true spirit of Kuno’s – its never say die attitude and the ability to survive and ultimately grow despite many challenges this forest has overcome.',
    'introduction-p3'  =>  'This area which has become a National Park today started out as a sanctuary of about 350 sq. kms. And was in shape of a leaf with Kuno river forming the main centre spine. This river not only helps in keeping a constant water supply in the area and irrigating the forest from inside out but also gave this protected area its name. Since the project of reintroduction of Asiatic Lions has been on going for a while and one of the preconditions as raised by concerned authorities about the status of this protected area as Sanctuary not being worthy of hosting the lions, was upgraded to National Park while adding another about 400 sq kms to it and it is now 748 sq km of pristine forest area. The park lies within the larger Kuno Wildlife Division which has a total area of 1235 sq. km.',
    'history-p1'    =>  'Kuno National Park / Kuno Wildlife Division and surrounding area has historically been rich with wildlife. This area was known to be a dense forest in ancient times as well. One of the gazette of Gwalior princely state of year 1902, records that the Mughal Emperor Akbar while returning from Malwa region captured a big herd of elephants in the forests near Shivpuri in the year 1564. Abul fazal also mentioned this fact that Lions were found in this region and the last Lion in this region is known to be shot near to city of Guna in the year 1872.',
    'history-p2'    =>  'Kuno’s history is intricately woven with the history of Lions and various efforts to relocate Lions in some capacity or other from time to time in this area. It is impossible to talk about the history of this place without referring to the Lions and their relocation efforts.',
    'history-p3'    =>  'In the year 1904 Lord Curzon was invited for hunting by the then His Highness Madhavrao Scindia,the Ist, King of Gwalior. Lord Curzon was so much impressed with the forest of valley of Kuno that he immediately suggested the King to bring Lions from Junaghad, Gir and released in the forest. King Scindia started working on it with the audacity suitable to a Maharaja and tried collaborating on his level, with the Nawab of Junaghad. During those times he built massive enclosures at Dob Kund as the Lion acclimatization enclosures before their release into the forests. However his initial efforts went into vain. Even Lord Curzon tried to help by facilitating talks with Nawab and personally getting involved in relocation but the Nawad kept on delaying the project.',
    'history-p4'    =>  'Later Lord Curzon even presented the King with a letter addressed to the ruler of Abisinia (Current Ethopia) so that some lions from there could be brought to Kuno. A Persian expert named D.M. Zaal was made in charge of this project by the King and in 1905 , this project was allocated Rs. 1 lakh budget in that year. Mr. Zaal with support of the King was able to bring 10 lions from Africa. However, three of them died by the time they reached Bombay Harbour. Of the 7 surviving lions, 3 were males while remaining 4 were females and they were personally received by the King himself. He named the males as Bunde, Baanke and Majnu and the females as Ramailee, Rampyari, Bijli and Gaindi. These Lions were later released in the Jungles of Shivpuri instead of Kuno. Unfortunately these Lions turned into cattle lifters and man-eaters in between year 1910 to 1912 and due to this unfortunate turns of the events the project failed. Though the King’s dream of seeing Lions once again prosper in this landscape didn’t come true the way he had envisioned, but his efforts were bold and trailblazing to say the least.',
    'significance-p1'    =>  'The area surrounding Kuno river has been rich in biodiversity since ancient times. Its importance can be reflected in the 30,000-year-old cave paintings in nearby Pahargarh depicting multiple wild animals.',
    'significance-p2'    =>  'Government of Madhya Pradesh realising the significance of this place established the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary of about 345 square km in 1981 within a larger forest area of approximately 3300 square km. To further strengthen the Wildlife conservation and ensure proper management of this area an additional approx. 891 square km was later added as the buffer to establish the Kuno Wildlife Division of 1235 square km in 2002.',
    'significance-p3'    =>  'Biogeographically this area falls under the Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forest eco-region and the forest types found in this area include the Northern tropical dry deciduous forest, Southern tropical dry deciduous forest, Dry Savannah forest & grassland, Tropical riverine forest. It is equally rich in the faunal species and thus provide a rare amalgamation of various favourable factors for wildlife. The significance of this area is strengthened by the fact that because of its aptness on various parameters Wildlife Institute of India chose this as the most suitable location for Lion Reintroduction Program in its study.',
    'significance-p4'    =>  'Once the area was identified as the most suitable locations for the reintroduction of Asiatic Lion, the then management started making long term focussed efforts to improve this area as per the requirement beginning with relocating the villages from inside the park to place which is more beneficial to the residents of those villages as well as beneficial to the denizens of the forests. 24 villages were relocated outside the sanctuary from 1998 to 2003 and about 6258 hectare area was made available.',
    'significance-p5'    =>  'With consistent and determined efforts of the management body of the park, relocation of villages resulting in reduced biotic pressure and improvement in the floral, faunal and avifaunal density in the park , Government of Madhya Pradesh revised the status of this area, ameliorating it to become a National Park with 748.761 square km as the core and 557.278 buffer area as the buffer in December 2018. This upgradation of Kuno Sanctuary to Kuno National Park further cements it’s importance in the field of Wildlife Conservation in Central Indian Landscape.',
