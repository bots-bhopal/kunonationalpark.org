The stories and the legends from the land of Kuno, are as old as time itself and the denizens of this land can narrate endless tales of sacrifice and longing. The place is full of ancient forts and structures which have now been reclaimed by the forest, lush green vegetation dominated by the “Kardhai”, “Khair” and “Salai” trees, an amazing world having rich diversity and very high density of winged creatures, freely roaming	ungulates and carnivores and in the midst of all this flows the famous Kuno river, from which this park derives its name; which is the silent spectator to the national park’s rich history and testimony to its revitalization, re-emergence and revival from the verge of being completely wiped out to what it is today.',
